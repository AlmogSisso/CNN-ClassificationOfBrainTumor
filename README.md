# ANN-CNN â€“ Classification of MRI 
## Classification of brain tumor using MRI images with convolutional neural networks.
During our neural networks course project, we took code from Kaggle that examines a classification question for brain tumor detection using MRI scan images. Initially, we explored the code's stages, understood how it processed the data itself and prepared it for model training. The original code utilized the EfficientNetB3 model, a very powerful one, but initially, its results were around 80% accuracy.

Throughout our investigation, we modified the original model's hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracy. We ran over 30 different iterations, tracked the results, and adopted changes that improved performance.

Subsequently, we explored different models using transfer learning, employing VGG16 and MobileNetV1. With these models, we also adjusted parameters and recorded the best results.

Finally, we created a significantly larger dataset to balance the different classes, substantially increasing the size of our training set. We then ran the baseline model on this expanded dataset, achieving significantly higher accuracy levels than usual.
